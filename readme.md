# A simple maze
The walls are generated randomly. The treasure is hidden somewhere in the map, the goal is to find it. You can use a superpower mode to fly over the walls, which could help you to find a treasure easily. Superpower mode is valid for 10 seconds. Also, you can rehide the treasure.

## Ð¡ontrols

* The models and some other parameters can be changed in *constants.js* file
